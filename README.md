## My process
I started my whole project by reading the documentation that came with the file I downloaded
I then went ahead to create my html layout of how I wanted my work to me
I update the links as needed and made use of divs to group my content
I then added appropriate classes to the divs to make my work clean and not bulky when I add my CSS
I then added a seperate CSS file when I added my classes and the styling I wanted my work to have
I made use of margins, padding, colors, flexbox and others
I decided to vamp up my work a little bit as it wasnt specified if one had to follow specific rules
And thats about it
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/texture/) - For images

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 box-shadow: 0 5px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), 0 5px 5px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

### Continued development
I hope to get more comfortable with layout and the use of the flexbox

### Useful resources

(https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me remember something about box shadowing.
